#** Sun_Solar-Dryer-Prototype**
"SunHarvest" aims to address the pressing issue of food security in refugee settlements by introducing  Sun solar Dryer as an innovative and sustainable solution. This holistic initiative not only reduces post-harvest losses but also empowers refugees with a valuable skill, contributing to economic independence and overall well-being.
**Problems statements **
Refugee settlements are confronted with multifaceted challenges, with one of the most acute being food security in post harvests food storage. In response to this critical issue, we propose to establish a Sun Solar Dryer prototypes in these settlements as an innovative and sustainable solution to reduce food wastage and improve food storage, enhance food security, and improve the overall quality of life for the Refugees in the refugee settlements.

Sun Solar Dryer: 
Sun Solar Dryer (SSD) harness the abundant power of the sun to dehydrate various food items, effectively preserving them for extended periods. This technology not only reduces dependency on traditional methods, such as open_air drying, which can be inefficient and prone to animals that feed on them reducing their quantity and also mitigates the risk of contamination. By installing solar dyers, we aim to empower the refugees to preserve their harvests more effectively, contributing to the reduction of post harvest losses and fostering economic independencies.
