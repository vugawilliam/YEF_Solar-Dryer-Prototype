#** Sun_Solar-Dryer-Prototype** 
Aims to address the pressing issue of food security in refugee settlements by introducing  Sun solar Dryer as an innovative and sustainable solution. This holistic initiative not only reduces post-harvest losses but also empowers refugees with a valuable skill, contributing to economic independence and overall well-being.

**Problems statements **

Refugee settlements are confronted with multifaceted challenges, with one of the most acute being food security in post harvests food storage. In response to this critical issue, we propose to establish a Sun Solar Dryer prototypes in these settlements as an innovative and sustainable solution to reduce food wastage and improve food storage, enhance food security, and improve the overall quality of life for the Refugees in the refugee settlements.


Sun Solar Dryer: 

Sun Solar Dryer (SSD) harness the abundant power of the sun to dehydrate various food items, effectively preserving them for extended periods. This technology not only reduces dependency on traditional methods, such as open_air drying, which can be inefficient and prone to animals that feed on them reducing their quantity and also mitigates the risk of contamination. By installing solar dyers, we aim to empower the refugees to preserve their harvests more effectively, contributing to the reduction of post harvest losses and fostering economic independencies.

**Aims of the Sun Solar Dryer**

    • To reduce food shortage and waste management and improve post-harvest processes
    • To achieve the sustainable development goals of 2030 number 2 which aims to improve security
    • To equip the different locals in the community with the knowledge of this skill.
    • To make it as an Open Educational resource (OER)  for other people to develop and expand its existence.

**The Objectives of Sun Solar Dryer**

    • Reduce food shortage and waste in refugee settlements.
    • Contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) by 2030.
    • Empower local communities with solar drying skills for sustainable food preservation.
    • Establish an Open Educational Resource (OER) for knowledge-sharing and expansion.
    
**Advantages of Sun Solar Dryers:**

    • Faster drying of harvest, saving time and resources.
    • Protection from animals, dust, fungi, and rain, ensuring higher-quality dried produce.
    • Lower risk of spoilage due to the rapid sun drying process.
    • Less labor-intensive, promoting efficiency and ease of use.
    • Improved quality of harvest in terms of nutrients, hygiene, and color.
    
**Materials for Sun Solar Dryer prototype:**

    • Timber
    • Nails
    • Wood glue
    • Tape measure
    • Hammer
    • Transparent Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) or glass
