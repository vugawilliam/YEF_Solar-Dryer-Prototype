# YEF_Solar-Dryer-Prototype
"SunHarvest" aims to address the pressing issue of food security in refugee settlements by introducing solar dryers as an innovative and sustainable solution. This holistic initiative not only reduces post-harvest losses but also empowers refugees with a valuable skill, contributing to economic independence and overall well-being.
